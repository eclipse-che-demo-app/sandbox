# Quarkus & Angular Application Demo in Eclipse Che (OpenShift Dev Spaces)

This project was created as part of a demo for Eclipse Che: [OpenShift - Your New Favorite IDE](https://upstreamwithoutapaddle.com/blog%20post/2023/04/06/Development-On-OpenShift-With-Eclipse-Che.html)

This code repository contains new features that I am testing or experimenting with.
